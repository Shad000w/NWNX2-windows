Readme for Time Plugin

There is no real documentation yet, just some notes:

1) Check out the time_demo.mod module. It times out two subsequent script calls which are 0.25 second apart.
2) The time_demo module also contains an include file (nwnx_time) for easy usage of the timer functions.
3) The plugin creates a text file next to the other nwnx log files: nwnx_time.txt. This file contains all timers and their measurements.
