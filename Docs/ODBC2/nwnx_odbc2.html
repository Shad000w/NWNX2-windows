<h3>I. Introduction - What does APS/NWNX ODBC2 do?</h3>

<p>APS is a set of scripts written for Neverwinter Nights that work with NWNX2 to
produce reliable persistence in a module. At the heart of the APS is
an include file that lists a number of custom made functions for governing
persistence. These functions can be used as is in your module or changed to
suit your needs.

<p>Whenever a script work with persistent data, it calls our APS functions 
and the Extender pulls the query out of the memory of the NWN server. It then 
passes it to the database, and writes the result of the query back into the 
memory of the server. The database has been tested with MySQL, MS-SQL, 
PostgresSQL, Microsoft Access, and the internal SQL database engine so far. Conceivably, any database with a 
decent ODBC driver will work. 

<p>We have included a demo module that illustrates how to use APS/NWNX ODBC2 and makes 
creating the database tables easy, and a second module demonstrating how 
persistent containers could be implemented.

<p><b>Licence</b><br> APS and NWNX2 ODBC2 are distributed unter the terms of the GNU 
GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE included in <a href="../licence.txt">licence.txt</a>.

<h3>II. Installing and updating APS</h3>

<h4>A. Installing the plugin</h4> 

<p>Copy the file nwnx_odbc.dll to you NWN folder, and aps_demo.mod 
to your NWN module folder.

<h4>B. Importing the erf</h4>

<p>In order to be able to use the APS functions, you will need to import
the aps_include file into your module.

<ol>
<li>Place the file "aps2.erf" into the C:\Neverwinternights\NWN\erf directory.
<li>In the toolset, open up the module into which you wish to install the
scripts.
<li>Under the File Menu, click Import. A window will pop up.
<li>Make sure the contents of the C:\Neverwinternights\NWN\erf directory are
showing in the window
<li>Select "aps2.erf" from the list
<li>Click Import and ignore any messages about missing resources (click Yes).
</ol>

<p>The following scripts should now be imported: aps_onload, aps_include.

<h4>C. Updating from previous versions</h4> 

<ul>
<li>from ODBC v2.5 to ODBC2: Copy the new DLL into your NWN folder. 
Edit the database connection parameters in your nwnx.ini file (check the
supplied example INI file what parameters can be used). Import the updated
aps_include file (from ap2.erf) into your module.
</ul>

<a name="III"></a>
<h3>Setting up a database</h3>

<p>The first choice you have to make is what database you are going to use. 
We strongly suggest starting out with the internal SQL database (SQLite), which 
is one of the fastest and easiest options. It also comes with a prepared datase 
that is ready to go. Read the section "Configuration for the internal database" on 
how to set this up.

<p>If you are using MySQL, go to the section "Configuration for MySQL 
database". If you are using any other database with an ODBC driver, go 
to the section "Configuration for ODBC database".

<h4>3.a. Configuration for the internal database</h4>

The internal NWNX ODBC2 database is based on SQLite v3, which is a fast SQL 
compliant database that developers can package with their applications - and 
that is what we did ! The main benefits of SQLite for NWN users are twofold:

<ol>
<li>It is fast.
<li>It is easy to setup (zero configuration).
</ol>

<p>Note: We recommend this type of database for single instance servers, 
meaning setups where only one NWN server is accessing the database. 
We recommend against using it in setups where multiple computers access 
the database simultaneously.

<p>Edit the nwnx.ini file and set the source= parameter to SQLite, and 
the file= parameter to the path and file where you want your database file:

<pre>
   [ODBC2]
   source = sqlite
   file = sqlite.db
</pre>

<p>Note: Omitting the path like in the example above will put the database 
file into your NWN folder. If you want it somewhere else, set the file 
parameter to e.g. c:\temp\nwn.db.

<p>Hint: One of the tools for working with the internal database is
<a href="http://home.student.uu.se/frax0795/">SQLiteCC</a>. It is not 
needed to follow the setup instructions in this document, but will come in
handy later.

<p>Advanced note: After opening the database file, an implicit transaction
is started automatically, since SQLite is significantly faster when access to 
the database is happening inside a transaction. If you want to access the
database concurrently, or if you want to handle transactions yourself, issue
a COMMIT right after the call to SQLInit to commit the implicit transaction.

<h4>3.b. Configuration for MySQL database</h4>

<p>Below the various parameters are listed which are required in the
configuration file nwnx.ini:

<ul>
<li>Server: Either the name or IP address of the database system which you are
using. Most of the time this will be your local machine: 'localhost'.
<li>User/pwd: This is the username and password of the user which will be 
used to connect to the database. For security reasons it is best to 
create a special user which has only access to the nwn database.
<li>DB: The database name.
</ul>

<p>An example configuration file is displayed below. In this configuration you 
tell the plugin to use the direct mysql connection to the database nwn. 
This database resides on the localhost (same machine as NWN runs) 
and should be connected with user 'your_user' and password 'your_pwd'.

<pre>
   [ODBC2]
   source = mysql
   server = localhost
   user   = your_user
   pwd    = your_pwd
   db     = nwn
</pre>

<p>Note: If your MySQL installation is not on the same machine you are 
installing this plugin too, you will need to copy the library libmysql.dll to 
your NWN folder as well, or ODBC2 will complain about a missing module.

<h4>3.c. Configuration for ODBC database</h4>

<p>If you have a different database system than MySQL you will use 
the ODBC connection method. In this section we will describe 
the steps needed to setup your system correctly. In the description 
below we asume that you are using Windows XP or a similar system.

<ul>
<li>Make sure your database system (including ODBC support) is installed 
and running correctly on your machine (with a remote database system you 
only need the ODBC drivers on your machine).
<li>Create an ODBC datasource: in the Control Panel select 
Administrative Tools and then Data Sources (ODBC). In the System Tab 
click on Add, and fill in the required fields. When finished the 
datasource should appear in the list (if not, consult your database 
system manual). 
</ul>

Edit the nwnx.ini file and set the dsn= parameter to the name you 
have just entered, e.g.:

<pre>
   [ODBC2]
   source = odbc
   dsn = nwn
</pre>

<h4>3.c. Creating the database tables</h4>

<p>Note: As there is an almost unlimited amount of different databases 
out there, we can not give detailed instructions for all of them. If you want 
to use a database server like MSSQL or PostgresSQL, try to follow the steps 
described below accordingly. If you are using the internal database, all tables have already been 
created for you (in the file sqlite.db). 

<p>Make sure your database is up and running and that you have a 
database that is accessible to the ODBC2 plugin. In order to store data in it, 
you have to create some tables in the database. The included module 
"aps_demo.mod" makes this easy for the internal database and MySQL. 
By default, it creates tables for the internal database. If you want to use
MySQL instead, open the module with the toolset and edit the scripts
"demo_createtable" and "demo_obj_create" accordingly.

<p>Next connect to your server with the Neverwinter Nights client. 
On the left side, you will see several different signs in front of you:

<ul>
<li>Create table: Issues a database command that creates a table 
in the database
<li>Store variable in database: Tries to save a test variable named 
"demoName" with the value "testValue" in the database
<li>Load variable from database: Tries to retrieve the variable 
"demoName" from the database and prints the results in the 
server message window. 
</ul>

<p>Now click every sign once, starting with the one on the 
left (Create Tables).

<p>If the last sign sends you the message "Retrieved variable from 
database: testValue" your setup is ok and you're ready to start using APS. 
Note: This is the most basic setup. We encourage you to use more 
sophisticated databases and data structures if you feel confident 
to do so (see below). 

<p> On the right side, you will see several different signs that do almost 
the same as the other signs, but they are dealing with object instead
of strings storage.

<p> If the variable is not retrieved correctly, check out the log file 
nwnx_odbc.txt for errors. Also check your database if the table really 
has been created. The SQL statement  that is executed by default is suitable for MySQL. If you use a
different database server, you should adjust that statement accordingly:

<p>Create a table "pwdata" with the following fields
player, tag, name, val, expire, last. Here is an example for MySQL
(taken from aps_demo.mod, script demo_createtable):

<pre>
    SQLExecDirect("CREATE TABLE pwdata (" +
        "player varchar(64) default NULL," +
        "tag varchar(64) default NULL," +
        "name varchar(64) default NULL," +
        "val text," +
        "expire int(11) default NULL," +
        "last timestamp(14) NOT NULL," +
        "KEY idx (player,tag,name)" +
        ")" );

</pre>

<h4>E. Using the persistence functions in your module</h4>

<ol>
<li>After installing according to the instructions above, go to Module
Properties under the Edit menu.
<li> Select aps_onload for your module OnModuleLoad event.<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;OR<br>
     Open aps_onload in the script editor and paste the contents of it into your
     pre-existing module's OnModuleLoad script. We only recommend doing this if you 
     are familiar with NWScript.
</ol>

The functions below are now implemented. Here is a lexicon containing
information on their purpose and use:

<p><b>void SQLInit()</b>
<p>Setup placeholders for ODBC requests and responses. This functions reserves memory APS and NWNX
use for communication. Call this function <b>once</b> in the module load event.

<pre>
    #include "aps_include"
</pre>
at the top of your script.
</ul>

<a name="IV"></a>
<h3>IV. Customization</h3>

<p>The APS is merely a set of custom functions that were originally used for the Avlis 
persistent world. The names of the functions and their parameters can be set to whatever
is convenient for your module. Below is a hypothetical example of how customization can be done.

<p>The "PowerG I33t" persistent world maintains their persistence with the Joe Bloe Persistence 
system (JBPS). In that system, a persistent string is set with the following JBPS function:

<p>SetStickySring(string sVariableName, string sVariableValue, object oTarget)

<p>All 5000 scripts in PowerG's elite world are written with the SetStickyString function, and they 
wish to retrofit their world to use NWNX. They would follow these steps:

<ol>
<li>Open up the file aps_include in the script editor.
<li>Change the name of the APS function called SetPersistentString to SetStickyString.
<li>Rearrange the parameters of: 

<p>SetPersistentString(object oObject, string sVarName, string sVarValue, int iExpiration, string sTable = "pwdata")<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to:<br>
SetStickyString(string VarName, string VarValue, object oObject, int iExpiration = 0, string sTable = "pwdata")<br>

<li>Build the module, i.e. recompile all scripts.

</ol>

<p>Once the module is restarted, all of PowerG I33t's old persistent string scripts should be running the 
new persistence system. All it took was changing one script.

<p>The above example is a simplified one, and the rest of the functions in the JBPS would need to be changed
in the same manner. In cases where the function parameters were completely not equivalent to those used
by the APS, they may have to be changed throughout every script in the module. Many but not all of the 
persistence systems out there should be convertible by the above method. We encourage further modification
of aps_include to tailor the variable handling to your needs.

<p>For persistence systems that use tokens, conversion will not be as easy. In these systems, token items
are used to represent information on a player character. These tokens are not lost because they are
actually in the inventory of the character. Because these systems work with tokens and not actual variables
it will be hard to convert them into a database format. The module will most likely have to be completely
re-fitted.

<p>On possible idea to do this scriptomatically would be to write a module OnEnter script that strips the
character of their tokens and issues SetPersistent variable commands into the database before destroying
them. That would preserve the information that is there, but handling the actual scripts throughout the
module will have to be done separately.

<p>Alternatively, you can have a look at the GetPersistentString() function in 
"aps_include". There are some comments in this functions that should give you 
ideas on how to convert persistent data from your current system to APS.

<h3>V. Speed comparison </h3>

<p>To give you an idea what to expect from the various database options, we 
conducted a small test involving 500 writes and reads. Note that this test is 
very artificial, since many aspects like table fragmentation, concurrent access,
database size, and more realistic queries are not factored in. All tests were 
done on a Athlon 64 3200+ with database server, NWServer, and NWClient 
running local (NWClient with reduced process priority).

<p>Writes were done with the following code:
<pre>
    for (i = 0; i < 500; i++)
    {
        SQLExecDirect("INSERT INTO pwdata (player, tag, name,val) values " +
            "('~', '~', 'iter_" + IntToString(i) + "', 'value')");
    }
</pre>

<p>Reads were done with the following code:
<pre>
    SQLExecDirect("SELECT * from pwdata");
    while (SQLFetch() == SQL_SUCCESS) {}
</pre>

<p>Bioware DB reads and write were done with the following code:
<pre>
    for (i = 0; i < 500; i++)
    {
        SetCampaignString("test", "iter_" + IntToString(i), "value");
      -- respecively --
        s = GetCampaignString("test", "iter_" + IntToString(i));
    }
</pre>

<p>Comments:
<ul>
<li>SQLITE (1): Using a transaction. No commit after the for loop.
<li>SQLITE (2): Using a transaction. Commit after the for loop.
<li>SQLITE (3): Not using a transaction. Terribly slow ! Note that 
NWNX ODBC2 starts an implicit transaction automatically. If you want 
to handle transactions yourself, issue a COMMIT right after SQLInit() 
to end the implicit transaction.
<li>Bioware DB (4): This comparison is a bit unfair, since the call to the 
Bioware database is significantly simpler and less flexible than its ODBC2 
counterpart. Real world examples utilizing e.g. SQL resultsets would probably 
favor ODBC2.
