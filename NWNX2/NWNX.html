<h3>I. Introduction to NWNX</h3>

<p>The Neverwinter Nights Extender (NWNX) is a program that has the power to 
push the limits on what you can do with NWN and its integrated script language.

<p>While NWN and the toolkit are complex and powerful tools, we at Avlis often 
felt that some things are just too limited, in order to successfully run a large 
persistent world. The first incarnation of NWNX brought the community realtime 
database access over ODBC, giving advanced scripters access to every conceivable 
DB they might want to use. During the time since the first release in February 
2003, I tried out various new ideas like linking servervaults with the help of 
NWNX, creating advanced data structures like hashmaps and linked lists, and played 
around with some debugging and profiling code. 

<p>NWNX actually consists of two parts: The executable, which displays the NWNX 
window and runs the process and gamespy watchdogs, and a dynamically linked 
library (DLL in the Windows version, .so in the linux version), which runs 
inside the NWN server.

<p>In order to establish communication between scripts and the outside world, 
NWNX intercepts calls to the NWScript function SetLocalString() and examines the 
variable name that is passed to this function. If it begins with the string 
"NWNX!", NWNX parses the request and stores any resulting data into the value of 
that variable, which in turn can be read by a script with GetLocalString(). 
Easy, huh ?

<p>After NWNX2 has loaded the server and rotated the log files, it takes over 
responsibility for restarting the server should it crash. It does not depend on 
a specific version of the server (1.65 as of this writing) and thus should work 
with upcoming releases, too. The current version supports all known versions of 
Microsoft Windows.

<p><b>Licence</b><br> NWNX is distributed unter the terms of the GNU 
GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE included in <a href="licence.txt">licence.txt</a>. NWNX
uses Mathias  Rauen's excellent library <a 
href="http://www.madshi.net">"madCHook"</a> which is licensed under the 
terms included in <a href="licence.txt">licence.txt</a>

<h3>II. NWNX plugins</h3>

<p>NWNX plugins are a new concept introduced in version 2.5. Because it soon became 
apparent that the wide variety of possible uses for NWNX would lead to bloated 
and unreadable code, if all that functionality would be in a single library, 
Avlis team member Jeroen created a "plugin framework" around the original NWNX. 
Every NWNX plugin is contained in a single library (DLL), which name begins with 
"nwnx_", e.g. "nwnx_odbc.dll" for the ODBC interface.

<p>One of the advantages of this approach is that you can choose which 
functionality you want to have available, and then just make use of a subset of 
the existing plugins. Say for example, you want to have database connectivity 
and a linked list implementation. Then you would just copy the two files 
"nwnx_odbc.dll" and "nwnx_llist.dll" into your NWN directory. NWNX dynamically 
loads these plugins on startup, enabling the functionality contained in these 
plugins.

<p>Another important advantage is that now third party developers can easily 
extend NWNX with their own ideas and make their plugin available to others in a 
unified way. So instead of having many different, incompatible versions of NWNX 
floating around, you always have one NWN executable, one NWN main library, and 
as many NWNX plugins as you like.

<p>Starting with version 2.5.4, the plugins are available as <i>separate downloads</i>
and no longer included in the main distribution package. This will make it 
easier for us and our users to stay up to date with the latest releases of NWNX 
and the various plugins.

<h3>III. Available plugins</h3>

<p>To give an overview of what is possible with NWNX, we list of some of the 
available plugins here. Get the latest versions of those plugins on <a 
href="http://www.nwnx.org"> nwnx.org</a>. The plugins come complete with 
documentation and a small demo module that demonstrates their usage. 

<h4>A. ODBC </h4>

<p>The historically most important plugin is the ODBC interface for Neverwinter 
Nights. Not so long ago, there wasn't any realtime database solution for NWN, 
when the Avlis team released the first version of NWNX, which suddenly opened a 
whole new world for owners of persistent worlds. This plugin and the accompanying 
APS (Avlis Persistence System) script is what made NWNX known in the community.

<h4>B. PROFILER </h4>

<p>The "Profiler" is a NWNX plugin that spits out statistics about running scripts. 
It shows how often a script has been called, how much time it took to complete, 
and gives some overall statistics. It also shows how much time CPU NPCs need for 
pathfinding.

<h4>C. HASHSET </h4>

<p>This plugin implements an advanced data structure, combining a hashmap and a 
set. This means you can set up associations between key - value pairs (hashmap), 
and also cycle through all stored data (set). You can even use this like an 
array, although it has much more to offer than just that.

<h4>D. FUNCTIONS </h4>

<p>This is an experimental plugin that gives access to some new functions to use 
with items. It's main purpose is to demonstrate how to modify the server's 
memory in order to change various properties on items.

<h4>E. TIME </h4>

<p>This plugin implements a simple, yet highly accurate timer. Perfect for 
knowing how long your functions really take to execute.

<h3>IV. Installing NWNX</h3>

<p>NWNX2 has been extensively tested on MS Windows 2000 and XP. Windows 9x has 
also been tested and we encountered no problems with NWNX2.

<p>Installing NWNX2 is super easy. Download the file and unzip it. Take the 
files "NWNX2.exe", "NWNX.INI", "nwnx-module.dll", and "madCHook.dll" and place 
them in the directory where your NWN installation resides (usually 
C:\Neverwinternights\NWN). Done! If you want to change the default configuration 
parameters of NWNX, edit the section [NWNX] in NWNX.INI accordingly.

<p>If you have a previous version of NWNX installed, remove the files 
nwnx.dll and madCodeHookLib.dll.

<p><b>Now copy the NWNX plugins you want to use into the NWN directory.</b>


<a name="V"></a>
<h3>V. Running NWNX</h3>

<p>Go to the directory where you installed Neverwinter Nights and double-click 
on "NWNX2.exe". You will see the small window of NWNX2 and shortly after that 
the NWN server starts. The NWNX2 window contains some statistics and checkboxes 
that control the watchdogs, i.e. the functionality which restarts the server 
after a crash. (you need to add the "-module" option so NWNX2 knows what module 
it should load after a crash). If you don't need the watchdogs, simply close 
NWNX2 after it started the server.

<p>Right before NWNX2 loads the server, it rotates it's own and the server's log files. You 
will find directories named "1"..."9" below your "logs.0" directory. The 
directory "1" always contains the newest logs, and "9" contains the oldest logs. 
All log files older than those in "9" are deleted to preserve disk space.

<p>All activity is logged to a file called "nwnx.txt". This file is created 
in your "logs.0" (or .1, .2, etc.) directory and looks like this:

<pre>
   NWN Extender V.2.6.1.0
   (c) 2004 by Ingmar Stieger (Papillon) and Jeroen Broekhuizen
   visit us at http://www.nwnx.org

   * Loading plugins...
   * Plugin functions is loaded.
   * Plugin odbc is loaded.
   * NWNX2 activated.
</pre>

<p>The NWN Extender will make sure your server is restarted should the module
crash. You can specify any commandline options Bioware's dedicated server
understands, e.g. you can automatically load a module on startup (or restart
after a crash) with: "NWNX2.exe" -module MODULENAME,

<h4>NWNX command line options</h4>

These options are understood by NWNX2. All other (i.e. unknown to NWNX2) options 
are passed to the server. <br>
Example command line:

<pre>
   C:\Neverwinter Nights\NWN\NWNX2.EXE -module "My Module" -publicserver 1 -gamespywatchdog 1
</pre>

<table border=1 cellpadding="5" width="80%">
 <tr>
  <th>Option</th>
  <th>Default value</th>
  <th>Description</th>
  <th>Example</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td> <nobr>-processwatchdog [0|1]</td>
  <td> <center>1 </td>
  <td> Set to 0 to disable the process type of watchdog, 1 to enable it.</td>
  <td> <nobr>-processwatchdog 1</td>
 </tr>  
 <tr>
  <td> <nobr>-processinterval 1..n </td>

  <td> In seconds. How often the process watchdog will check if the NWNights server process is still there.</td>
  <td> <nobr>-processinterval 7</td>
 </tr>

  <td> <nobr>-gamespywatchdog [0|1]</td>
  <td> <center>0 </td>
  <td> Set to 0 to disable the gamespy type of watchdog, 1 to enable it.</td>
  <td> <nobr>-gamespywatchdog 1</td>
 </tr>  
 <tr>
  <td> <nobr>-gamespyinterval 1..n</td>
  <td> <center>20 </td>
  <td> In seconds. How often the gamespy watchdog will check if the NWNights server process is still there and still responding to clients.</td>
  <td> <nobr>-gamespyinterval 60</td>
 </tr>  
 <tr>
  <td> <nobr>-gamespyretries 1..n</td>
  <td> <center>5 </td>
  <td> How many chances the gamespy watchdog will give the server to answer. If it got no answer after this many tries, the server process is killed and restarted. </td>
  <td> <nobr>-gamespyretries 3</td>  
 </tr>  
 <tr>
  <td> <nobr>-oldgamespyprotocol [0|1]</td>
  <td> <center>0 </td>
  <td> Set to 1 if you have a pre 1.32 server and make use of the gamespy watchdog.</td>
  <td> <nobr>-oldgamespyprotocol 1</td>  
 </tr>  
 <tr>
  <td> <nobr>-restartdelay 1..n</td>
  <td> <center>5 </td>
  <td> In seconds. How long NWNX will wait before it restarts the server.</td>
  <td> <nobr>-restartdelay 5</td>  
 </tr>  
</table>

<h4>NWNX.INI file</h4>

In adddition to the command line options, you can also set configuration 
parameters in the [NWNX] section of the NWNX.INI file, which should be in the 
same directory as NWNX2.EXE is. The following parameters are understood by the 
main program:

<pre>
   ServerPort = 5121
   ModuleName = "aps_demo"
   WatchdogProcess = yes
   UpdateIntervalProcess = 5
   WatchdogGamespy = no
   UpdateIntervalGamespy = 20
   GamespyRetries = 5
   OldGamespyProtocol = no
   RestartDelay = 5
</pre>

(the values shown here are the default values).

<p>These values can be overriden by command line parameters, so you could put 
most of your default options into the INI file, and specify special options 
(e.g. -port) on the command line.

<h3>VI. FAQ & Troubleshooting </h3>

<p><b>Q. What is NWNX?</b><br>

A. NWNX2 is a program that loads the NWN server and injects the functionality 
contained in the various NWNX plugins into the server. Setting special string 
variables using NWScript triggers the NWNX requests. The resulting data can 
be read with the usual string functions. 

<p><b>Q.What are the system Requirements for NWNX?</b><br>
A. NWNX currently works with all Windows operating systems. If your system 
processor can handle running Neverwinter Nights, it can more than handle NWNX.

<p><b>Q. Will there be a LINUX port?</b><br>
A. We have a version of NWNX2 for Linux available. Refer to 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/apsnwnx/"> our sourceforge page</a>.

<p><b>Q. Since NWNX is running the server as a child process, does the parent also have crash monitoring so it can 
auto-reboot the server if it crashes?</b><br>
A. If the child process crashes or becomes unresponsive to network traffic, NWNX will reboot it. 

<p><b>Q. Will I still be able to start my server up with firedaemon(or any other server crash utility)?</b><br>
A. NWNX will restart the server if needed. Firedaemon may possibly be able to restart NWNX instead of 
the server, but we have not looked into this at all.

<p><b>Q. Any chance the source code will be open sourced?</b><br>
A. Shortly after the initial release, the complete source code was released as part of the distribution of APS/NWNX2.
