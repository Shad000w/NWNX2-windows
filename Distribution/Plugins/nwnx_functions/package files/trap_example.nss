/*
	This works best being a DM
	For funs and giggles we're going to create a trap in the shape of a 5 pointed star.
	The trap is pretty large and in order to fully see it I recommend standing in the middle
	of an - at least - 8x8 area which is entirely flat (microset works pretty well)
	
	The coordinates for this are as follows:

		  X			  Y
		-2.5 		-7.79
		-8.18		0.03 
		6.63 		-4.79
		-2.55		-7.77
		6.6  		4.83 
		6.6  		-4.83
		-2.55	 	7.77 
		6.63 		4.79 
		-8.18		-0.03
		
	Why are there only 9 pairs of coordinates, when a 5 pointed star requires 10? (5 for the points pointing outward and 5 for the ones pointing inward)
	The first pair of coordinates - the origin - will be provided by the location parameter specifid in the call to CreateTrapAtLocation(...)
	The coordinates are also not absolute, but relative to each other:
	From the origin, move 2.5 to the left and 7.79 down (-2.5 / -7.79), from there move -8.18 left and 0.03 up and so on.
*/

//  Getting the coordinates into the game (NWNXFuncs_SetCustomTrapGeometry(string sGeometry))
/*	As you can see NWNXFuncs_SetCustomTrapGeometry takes a string as Parameter.
	This string is simply all the coordinates concatenated alternating x and y, and putting a ¬ (ALT+170) between each of them:
		X1¬Y1¬X2¬Y2¬...¬Xn¬Yn¬
	We also need to make sure that there's one last ¬ at the very end.
