Each subdirectory represents a plugin.  The .DLL file in each respective directory named nwnx_<plugin name>.dll
needs to be moved into the same directory as NWNX2.exe and your neverwinter nights installation to install it.
It will be activated next time NWNX2 is launched.

There may be package files, such as NWN Scripts or other resources, which may be needed to included in your module, 
dependent on the plugin you are using.  These resources, if any, can be found in the corresponding plugin's subdirectory.
